I‚Äôm the Data Training Coordinator at the xxx Center for xxx Analysis & xxx (xxx) located at xxx, where I‚Äôm working to develop and teach xxx training xxx for the xxx (xxx) and other initiatives across xxx and xxx. I am also a xxx of xxx, a local group which works to promote xxx. <!--  -->

My background is in xxx ‚Äì I was afforded opportunities to study xxx in xxx as an undergrad, then xxx in xxx for my Masters degree. Since the beginning of my time in STEM, I was totally terrified of all things data / coding / data science, but thanks to a super supportive community and some really rad colleagues / instructors, I found my new path and I absolutely love it.

## ü§òüèæ the hobby 

I feel very fortunate to be doing so many of things that I love a lot right now. That includes my job, but also spending lots of time playing drums and going to concerts.

I started playing drums when I was in high school, 20 years ago! Back then, I was playing along to the bands of my era (Audioslave, Linkin Park, System of a Down, etc.). But then, I had to go heavier, right? I went quickly from Metallica, Slipknot, and Slayer, to the real extreme ones -- I'm talking Sepultura, Dimmu Borgir, Vader, Nile... Every year I had to live, breathe, and play faster. Then, as my playing (and hopefully my mind) became more mature, I delved into more technical, more musically involved stuff, until I discovered bands like Death, Cynic, and Meshuggah. I did flirt with jazz for a while, and I learned a lot, but metal is my true love.

For the past year, I've started to be intentional about going to the concerts of the bands I love. Watching Cynic for the first time was very special; not just because of their flawless playing, but mostly because Paul Masvidal transpires so much peace, and because Cynic is not a hugely famous band, so it was a very small, intimate concert.

I've already checked off some of the bands I had in my todo list, like Nile, Meshuggah, Cynic, Depeche Mode. The next thing in my todo list is to dive into the pit and hopefully stage dive, although I have to be careful at my age üë¥üèæ.
