My work involves using techniques from natural language processing and multivariate statistical modeling to better understand the cognitive and linguistic mechanisms in language production.\nMy expertise extends to tools like Quarto, Git, Emacs, and Vim mode for effective data management and presentations. I am currently in the revision stage for a computational linguistics single-authored manuscript that will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the field. At the same time, I am co-authoring a second manuscript where we explore the perceptions of conversation partners on interaction training in the context of synchronous video computer-mediated communication (SVCMC)."

    "text": "ü§òüèæ the hobby\nI feel very fortunate to be doing so many of things that I love a lot right now. That includes my job, but also spending lots of time playing drums and going to concerts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFluffy lounging.\n\nI started playing drums when I was in high school, 20 years ago! Back then, I was playing along to the bands of my era (Audioslave, Linkin Park, System of a Down, etc.). But then, I had to go heavier, right? I went quickly from Metallica, Slipknot, and Slayer, to the real extreme ones ‚Äì I‚Äôm talking Krisiun, Bathory, Vader, Nile‚Ä¶ Every year I had to live, breathe, and play faster. Then, as my playing (and hopefully my mindset) became more mature, I delved into more technical, more musically involved stuff, until I discovered bands like Death, Cynic, and Meshuggah. I did flirt with jazz for a while, and I learned a lot, but metal is my true love.\nFor the past year, I‚Äôve started to be intentional about going to the concerts of the bands I love. Watching Cynic for the first time was very special; not just because of their flawless playing, but mostly because Paul Masvidal transpires so much peace, and because Cynic is not a crazy famous band, so it was a very small, intimate concert. By comparison, Ulver (already very niche band) had 132,314 monthly listeners as of Jan 20 2025, whereas Cynic had only 38,598 monthly listeners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul from Cynic.\n\nI‚Äôve already checked off some of the bands I had in my todo list, like Nile, Meshuggah, Cynic, Depeche Mode. The next thing in my todo list is to dive into the pit and hopefully stage dive, although I have to be careful at my age üë¥üèæ. Update: I did it already ‚Äì I fell down in the middle of the pit. I‚Äôm ok lol.\nFeel free to reach out! Here‚Äôs my resume and my socials below."

    "text": "posted  June 22, 2023\n\nProject overview\nPart of my Ph.D.¬†comprehensive examination consists of writing two full, single-authored research papers of publishable quality. This is the first one of those papers. I was inspired by a study written by Bresnan et al. (2007). In their original paper, the authors challenged the traditional reliance on made-up examples in linguistics. They showed that by analyzing real-world language patterns using advanced statistical techniques, we can uncover a much richer and complex picture of how grammar actually works. This is particularly evident in phenomena like the dative alternation, where speakers have a choice between seemingly interchangeable phrasings, like I gave the book to Mary vs.¬†I gave Mary the book.\nConsider this ‚Äì if we compare (i) Who sent the box to Germany? with (ii) Who sent Germany the box?, speakers will likely find (ii) somewhat odd; this is because the animacy of the recipient (Germany ‚Äì an inanimate noun) is one important factor that influences the choice between one phrasing vs.¬†the other (Winter, 2020). In contrast, when there is an animate recipient, the (ii) structure/type seems to work just fine, e.g., Who sent Sarah the box? Other factors governing the dative alternation are the length of the constituents, the type of noun phrase (e.g., pronominal vs.¬†non-pronominal), whether the recipient/patient was mentioned in previous discourse or not, among other factors. Bresnan et al. (2007) showed that linguistic predictors must be examined using multilevel modeling, because such factors are nested and co-dependent, acting simultaneously upon the outcome variable.\nWhat I did in my own paper was to explore whether speakers of other languages show similar usage patters of the dative alternations compared to English speakers.
