Back then, I was playing along to songs from the bands of my era (Audioslave, Linkin Park, System of a Down, etc.). But then, I had to go heavier, right? I went quickly from Metallica, Slipknot, and Slayer, to the real extreme ones ‚Äì I‚Äôm talking Krisiun, Bathory, Vader, Nile‚Ä¶ Every year I had to live, breathe, and play faster. Then, as my playing (and hopefully my mindset) became more mature, I delved into more technical, more musically involved stuff: I discovered bands like Death, Cynic, and Meshuggah. I did flirt with jazz for a while, I even played in a big band for about a year. I learned a lot, but eventually I acknowledged that metal was my true love.\nFor the past two years (after a lot of Ph.D.¬†trauma), I‚Äôve started to be intentional about going to the concerts of the bands I love. Watching Cynic for the first time was very special; not just because of their flawless playing, but mostly because Paul Masvidal transpires so much peace, and because Cynic is not a crazy famous band, so it was a very small, intimate concert. By comparison, Ulver (already very niche band) had 132,314 monthly listeners as of Jan 20 2025, whereas Cynic had only 38,598 monthly listeners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul from Cynic.\n\nI‚Äôve already checked off some of the bands I had in my todo list, like Nile, Meshuggah, Cynic, Depeche Mode. The next thing in my todo list is to dive into the pit and hopefully stage dive, although I have to be careful at my age üë¥üèæ. Update: I did it already ‚Äì I fell down in the middle of the pit.

    "text": "posted  June 22, 2023\n\nProject overview\nPart of my Ph.D.¬†comprehensive examination consists of writing two full, single-authored research papers of publishable quality. This is the first one of those papers. I was inspired by a study written by Bresnan et al. (2007). In their original paper, the authors challenged the traditional reliance on made-up examples in linguistics. They showed that by analyzing real-world language patterns using advanced statistical techniques, we can uncover a much richer and complex picture of how grammar actually works. This is particularly evident in phenomena like the dative alternation, where speakers have a choice between seemingly interchangeable phrasings, like I gave the book to Mary vs.¬†I gave Mary the book.\nConsider this ‚Äì if we compare (i) Who sent the box to Germany? with (ii) Who sent Germany the box?, speakers will likely find (ii) somewhat odd; this is because the animacy of the recipient (Germany ‚Äì an inanimate noun) is one important factor that influences the choice between one phrasing vs.¬†the other (Winter, 2020). In contrast, when there is an animate recipient, the (ii) structure/type seems to work just fine, e.g., Who sent Sarah the box? Other factors governing the dative alternation are the length of the constituents, the type of noun phrase (e.g., pronominal vs.¬†non-pronominal), whether the recipient/patient was mentioned in previous discourse or not, among other factors. Bresnan et al. (2007) showed that linguistic predictors must be examined using multilevel modeling, because such factors are nested and co-dependent, acting simultaneously upon the outcome variable.\nWhat I did in my own paper was to explore whether speakers of other languages show similar usage patters of the dative alternations compared to English speakers.

    "text": "Task: Port the Openscapes website from blogdown to Quarto\nTo start, what does port mean? While it may be obvious to some, I feel like this word is sort of jargon-y. I first learned of it when Quarto was thrust into the spotlight and the R community at large began ‚Äúporting their websites from distill/blogdown/etc to Quarto‚Äù. I came to understand that (at least in this context) ‚Äúport‚Äù means ‚Äúto convert or migrate‚Äù a website from one framework to another (or in other words, rebuild a website using different tools).\nSo why the need to port the Openscapes website to Quarto? Julie originally built the site back in 2018 using blogdown and the Universal Theme for Hugo (you can still check out the GitHub repo) ‚Äì and it was really beautiful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the old Openscapes website‚Äôs landing page, built using blogdown.\n\nUnfortunately, upgrades to Hugo were beyond Julie‚Äôs scope to maintain which meant the site could no longer build locally (i.e.¬†you couldn‚Äôt preview the site on a personal computer). This meant that the site needed to be redeployed in order to view any changes. Not only was this a rather slow process, but it also meant that there was no easy way to test out new additions/pages/features (or even check for typos) before sharing those updates with the rest of the online world. Additionally, the Openscapes team has used Quarto since its earliest days (read more about that in their quarto blog posts) ‚Äì it seemed like a good time as any to begin using this same tool for building the Openscapes website as well."

Rebuilding the Openscapes website meant diving deeper into custom layouts, responsive web pages, and generally, a whole lot of stuff I had little to no familiarity with‚Ä¶which honestly really scared me (aren‚Äôt freelancers supposed to know how to do what they‚Äôre being hired to do??). With Julie‚Äôs reassurances that not knowing was okay, and that there was time and space to learn together (very on brand for the community she and her team foster through Openscapes ), I set off on my first freelancing adventure."

The most challenging part was creating a custom landing page that both matched the aesthetics of the blogdown site and that looked good on smaller viewports/mobile devices ‚Äì this ended up being the last thing I addressed before wrapping up the project. Ultimately, I was able to recreate a Quarto-based Openscapes website that looked nearly identical to the blogdown version ‚Äì it was really cool to see how flexible Quarto allows you to be!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the new Openscapes website‚Äôs landing page, built using Quarto! We were able to recreate the landing page so that it looked pretty darn similar to the blogdown site.\n\n\nIncorporate events: Openscapes Events were historically announced through a separate Events blog, which we decided to incorporate fully into the Openscapes website on its own events listing.\nFeedback & updates: Stef and Julie did multiple deep dive reviews of the website and I made changes based off their suggestions/requests. Some of these were minor (e.g.¬†‚ÄúCan we add a bit more vertical space in underlined text‚Äù, ‚Äúthis hyperlinked text is broken‚Äù), while others required a bit more thought (e.g.¬†‚Äúlet‚Äôs rethink how we structure content on this page‚Äù, figuring out CSS to style particular page elements). They also had the chance to share the website with a focus group, which provided invaluable feedback on content organization, language, etc. (e.g.¬†‚Äúremove unnecessary text from the landing page‚Äù, ‚Äúreplace the words instructional materials with curriculum‚Äù)\nMore feedback & updates: The hardest part and also the most fun part was the back-and-forth discussion on how to rethink, try out, and change the website. We fiddled a lot with content reorganization and CSS styling to better highlight different resources/elements. It was a super collaborative and iterative process to get things to where they are now!\nFigure out responsive web pages: I saved the most technically challenging part (at least for me) for last ‚Äì learning how to create responsive web pages (where content adjusts size and positioning based on viewport size) involved a lot of trial and error.\nDeploy with Netlify & troubleshoot redirects: It took us a minute to understand how to get redirects to work. I won‚Äôt go into that here, but you can read about our solution on our redirects wiki."

    "section": "Reflecting on the stand-out moments",
    "text": "Reflecting on the stand-out moments\nBuilding this website has been a real journey (a 6-month long one)! While I can‚Äôt recount all the details here, I did want to reflect on a few things I‚Äôm most excited about:\n\nGreatest victory: responsive web pages\nA responsive web page is one with elements that automatically resize and reorganize based on the size and shape of the viewport and/or device it‚Äôs being viewed on. This responsiveness is critically important for ensuring a high quality user experience, no matter how a user is accessing the website.\nFor example, note how elements organized in columns (e.g.¬†Engage/Empower/Amplify, the three stat boxes) when the browser viewport is at full width will stack vertically once the browser window is made narrower (elements will also be stacked vertically when viewed on a mobile device):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas opposed to columns getting crunched when the browser window is made narrower:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI left figuring this out until the very end‚Ä¶mostly because I had no idea how to approach doing so. The Quarto documentation makes reference to Bootstrap‚Äôs CSS Grid and provides a simple, but clear example of creating columns in our Quarto doc. This helped me get started on a non-responsive 3-column layout, which looks like this:\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\nleft-hand column content\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\ncenter column content\n:::\n  \n::: {.g-col-4}\nright-hand column content\n:::  \n\n:::\n\nwhere {.g-col-4} defines the width of the column (Bootstrap‚Äôs grid system has a total of 12 columns across a page, so each of our 3 columns will be a width of 4).\nI got stuck for a long while after this point ‚Äì the CSS Grid documentation makes it clear that this approach can be used to create responsive columns, but I found the provided example to be a bit confusing. After a lot of trial and error, and stumbling across this table that (sort of) makes reference to .g-col vs.¬†.g-col-md classes from the CSS Grid documentation example, I eventually got myself some working responsive columns. While I still don‚Äôt fully understand it, this is my best attempt at explaining my working solution‚Ä¶here‚Äôs what it looks like:\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}\nleft-hand column content\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}\ncenter column content\n:::\n  \n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}\nright-hand column content\n:::  \n\n:::\n\n.g-col-12 represents the width of each column when the viewport is made smaller (e.g.¬†either a narrow browser window or on a mobile device) ‚Äì since the width of our browser is a total of 12 units, each column will take up the full width of the browser and be forced to stack vertically.\n.g-col-md-4 represents the width of each column when the viewport is made larger (e.g.¬†a browser window that takes up a full laptop screen) ‚Äì in this case, each column will only take up 4 units, or a third of the full width of the browser and can sit side-by-side one another.\nHere‚Äôs the above example in action:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, I used this approach for all pages that needed responsive columns (largely the landing page, but also the Our Team page and Resources page). If you end up finding this helpful in your own responsive web page journey ‚Äì Yay!! If you have an alternative or improved solution, or if you understand these CSS grid classes more than I do, please do drop me a line ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to hear all about it \n\n\nFavorite new thing(s) learned: mobile device previews and regex\nOkay, I couldn‚Äôt choose one, so here are my top two:\n\nPreviewing a web page for mobile device viewing: When building my own personal website, I always took the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make changes, redeploy, then check it out on my phone to see how it looks‚Äù approach‚Ä¶which is never ideal. Huge shout out to my husband, Brendan Shanny, who showed me that you can preview a website as it would appear on a mobile device directly from Google Chrome. Right click on a web page &gt; choose Inspect &gt; click on the button with the laptop and phone icon in the top left corner of the Inspect pane to toggle between standard computer and mobile viewport sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView a web page as if on a mobile device by clicking on the laptop/phone button (circled in red) at the top of the Inspect pane.\n\n\nRegular expressions (regex) are really powerful: I‚Äôve heard the terms ‚Äúregular expressions‚Äù and ‚Äúregex,‚Äù and I know they underlie some really powerful R packages (e.g.¬†{stringr} for manipulating character strings), but I never really knew what they were or how to use them. Julie first introduced me to using regex during one late-night co-working session (she broke out her original copy of Practical Computing for Biologists, by Steven H. D. Haddock and Casey W. Dunn, which includes an excellent primer). Not more than a few days later, we realized we needed to reformat our redirects file, changing the way blog post URLs were represented from this:\n\n\n# Redirects from what the browser requests to what we serve\nblog/2021/03/10-nasa-announcement /blog/2021-03-10-nasa-announcement\nblog/2021/05/03-noaa-nwfsc-champions /blog/2021-05-03-noaa-nwfsc-champions\nblog/2022/02/17-esip-winter-2022 /blog/2022-02-17-esip-winter-2022\n\nto this:\n\n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/blog/2021/03/10-nasa-announcement/\" \n  to = \"/blog/2021-03-10-nasa-announcement/\"\n  status = 301\n\n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/blog/2021/05/03-noaa-nwfsc-champions/\" \n  to = \"/blog/2021-05-03-noaa-nwfsc-champions/\"\n  status = 301\n  \n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/blog/2022/02/17-esip-winter-2022/\" \n  to = \"/blog/2022-02-17-esip-winter-2022/\"\n  status = 301\n\nUsing regular expressions (directly in RStudio!) to create patterns for matching, locating, and manipulating text allowed me to quickly reformat the 100+ redirects all at once. I documented my workflow in our redirects wiki.\n\n\nFavorite website feature: wikis\nMy favorite website feature is actually not a feature of the website itself (), but rather our GitHub Wiki for documenting conventions and workflows for current/future maintainers.\nWhile most of my notes initially ended up in GitHub Issues (e.g.¬†page structure/styling conventions (issue #4), Using knitr::include_graphics() (issue #11)), wikis seemed to be a more organized solution for sharing these notes (and other important information) with those who will be maintaining and making changes to the website moving forward. Wiki articles range from creating and categorizing new blog posts to adding images to the website in a consistent way to an overview of styling the website using Sass & CSS.\nI‚Äôm honestly so jazzed about wikis at the moment and plan to start using them more to share project-specific information. Recently I created a wiki to provide setup instructions for workshop participants ‚Äì in the past, I‚Äôve linked a shared Google Doc in the repository‚Äôs README with similar setup information, which is effective, but harder to keep track of as a maintainer.\n\n\nMost valuable personal growth moment: overcoming imposter syndrome\nI‚Äôve struggled with imposter syndrome throughout my professional career (as so many do!) ‚Äì and it is hard to shake the feeling that I‚Äôm not qualified to be doing [fill in the blank with any one of the things that I get in my own head about]. This project was not one of those things. And I totally credit it to the supportive (and just generally fun) community that Julie and Stef create. It‚Äôs not easy to foster an honest no-such-thing-as-failing environment, but I really felt that way from the moment I got started (which says a lot, given that I‚Äôd be learning on the go for much of the project). I feel very lucky and honored that they trusted me with this work.\nThe Openscapes team certainly practices what they preach ‚Äì you can read all about the Openscapes Approach for promoting psychological safety, kinder science, and a growth mindset, as well as explore the many other great resources developed by Openscapes.\n\nYou can check out the Openscapes website at https://openscapes.org/.

Together, we‚Äôll build an interactive table, plot, and map, and demonstrate how these outputs can be shared using open data science communication tools, like RMarkdown and Quarto.\n\n\nAudience\nThis workshop was developed for and taught during the SORTEE Workshops and Webinar series."

    "text": "I am an applied computational linguist and Ph.D.¬†student at Michigan State University. I focus on analyzing linguistic phenomena in the context of second language teaching and learning. My work involves using techniques from natural language processing and multivariate statistical modeling to better understand the cognitive and linguistic mechanisms in language production.\nMy expertise extends to tools like Quarto, Git, Emacs, and Vim mode for effective data management and presentations. I am currently in the revision stage for a computational linguistics single-authored manuscript that will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the field. At the same time, I am co-authoring a second manuscript where we explore the perceptions of conversation partners on interaction training in the context of synchronous video computer-mediated communication (SVCMC)."

    "text": "course website  course catalog\n\n\nCourse Description\nEffectively communicating your work in a responsible, accessible and visually-pleasing way is often (if not, always) a central part of data science. This course will focus on the basic principles for effective communication through data visualization and using technical tools and workflows for creating and sharing data visualizations with diverse audiences.\nBy the end of this course, learners should be able to:\n\nIdentify which types of visualizations are most appropriate for your data and your audience\nPrepare (e.g.¬†clean, explore, wrangle) data so that it‚Äôs appropriately formatted for building data visualizations\nBuild effective, responsible, accessible, and aesthetically-pleasing, visualizations using the R programming language, and specifically {ggplot2} + ggplot2 extension packages\nWrite code from scratch and read and adapt code written by others\nApply a DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) lens to the process of designing data visualizations\nAssess, critique, and provide constructive feedback on data visualizations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen is this taught?\nEDS 240 is a core course of the Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program, taught in Winter quarter each year (since the inaugural cohort, Winter 2022). I am re-envisioning and teaching it for the first time in Winter 2024. Materials are still very much under development (as of Dec 2023) and untested ‚Äì I‚Äôm looking forward to reflecting on what worked and what to improve on after I finish up teaching in March 2024."
