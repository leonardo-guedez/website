## {{< fa chalkboard-teacher title="A teacher at a chalkboard" >}} the profession

I’m the Data Training Coordinator at the xxx Center for xxx Analysis & xxx (xxx) located at xxx, where I’m working to develop and teach xxx training xxx for the xxx (xxx) and other initiatives across xxx and xxx. I am also a xxx of xxx, a local group which works to promote xxx. <!--  -->

My background is in xxx – I was afforded opportunities to study xxx in xxx as an undergrad, then xxx in xxx for my Masters degree. Since the beginning of my time in STEM, I was totally terrified of all things data / coding / data science, but thanks to a super supportive community and some really rad colleagues / instructors, I found my new path and I absolutely love it.

Teaching MEDS students how to build their own personal websites using Quarto! This was especially fun for me, since Quarto was still such a new tool when I first gave this workshop -- it meant a lot of discovery and learning on-the-fly alongside our students.

I’m afforded a lot of flexibility in how I teach and what I teach. My focus is on developing and delivering xxx that supplement the xxx. I xxx primarily via xxx – I am always looking for new ways to make my teaching style and materials more approachable and inclusive for all learners.

## {{< fa hiking title="A person with a backpack and trekking pole" >}} the hobby 

I feel very fortunate to be doing so many of things that I love a lot right now. That includes my job, but also spending lots of time outdoors. Living in Santa Barbara is a massive privilege and being here means that we have access to both the mountains and the sea, each a few minutes in either direction. It was the ocean that brought me here originally, but most of my free time is now spent on the trails.

I started recording my hikes (and eventually some other activities) on Strava in late 2020 and finally got around to retrieving my activity data using the {rStrava} package. Below is a heatmap of all my recorded activities made using leaflet. It’s challenging to see individual markers at my most frequented trailheads / starting points (toggle markers on using the layer controls in the top right corner), so I’ve recently began building out my own Strava Dashboard (using {shinydashboard}) to make it a bit more interactive and filterable – it’s a work in progress, but a fun side project that I’m excited to continue iterating upon. Huge shout out to Daniel Cullen (who also happens to be a Santa Barbara resident!) for his awesome blog post that got me started with my own map.
