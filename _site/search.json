    "text": "ü§òüèæ the hobby\nI feel very fortunate to be doing so many of things that I love a lot right now. That includes my job, but also spending lots of time playing drums and going to concerts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFluffy lounging.\n\nI started playing drums when I was in high school, 20 years ago! Back then, I was playing along to the bands of my era (Audioslave, Linkin Park, System of a Down, etc.). But then, I had to go heavier, right? I went quickly from Metallica, Slipknot, and Slayer, to the real extreme ones ‚Äì I‚Äôm talking Krisiun, Bathory, Vader, Nile‚Ä¶ Every year I had to live, breathe, and play faster. Then, as my playing (and hopefully my mindset) became more mature, I delved into more technical, more musically involved stuff, until I discovered bands like Death, Cynic, and Meshuggah. I did flirt with jazz for a while, and I learned a lot, but metal is my true love.\nFor the past year, I‚Äôve started to be intentional about going to the concerts of the bands I love. Watching Cynic for the first time was very special; not just because of their flawless playing, but mostly because Paul Masvidal transpires so much peace, and because Cynic is not a crazy famous band, so it was a very small, intimate concert. By comparison, Ulver (already very niche band) had 140,895 monthly listeners as of March 28 2024, whereas Cynic had only 44,859 monthly listeners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul from Cynic.\n\nI‚Äôve already checked off some of the bands I had in my todo list, like Nile, Meshuggah, Cynic, Depeche Mode. The next thing in my todo list is to dive into the pit and hopefully stage dive, although I have to be careful at my age üë¥üèæ.\n\nFeel free to reach out! Here‚Äôs my CV and my socials below.\n\n    ùïè"

    "text": "I am an applied computational linguist and Ph.D.¬†student at Michigan State University. I focus on analyzing linguistic phenomena in the context of second language teaching and learning. My work involves using techniques from natural language processing and multivariate statistical modeling to better understand the cognitive and linguistic mechanisms in language production.\nMy expertise extends to tools like Quarto, Git, Emacs, and Vim mode for effective data management and presentations. I am currently in the revision stage for a computational linguistics single-authored manuscript that will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the field. At the same time, I am co-authoring a second manuscript where we explore the perceptions of conversation partners on interaction training in the context of synchronous video computer-mediated communication (SVCMC)."
