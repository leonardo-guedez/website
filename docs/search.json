    "text": "I am an applied computational linguist and Ph.D. student at Michigan State University. I focus on analyzing linguistic phenomena in the context of second language teaching and learning. My work involves using techniques from natural language processing and multivariate statistical modeling to better understand the cognitive and linguistic mechanisms in language production.\nMy expertise extends to tools like Quarto, Git, Emacs, and Vim mode for effective data management and presentations. I am currently in the revision stage for a computational linguistics single-authored manuscript that will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the field. At the same time, I am co-authoring a second manuscript where we explore the perceptions of conversation partners on interaction training in the context of synchronous video computer-mediated communication (SvCMC)."
