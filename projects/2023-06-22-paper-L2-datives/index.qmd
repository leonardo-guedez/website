# Project overview

Part of my Ph.D. comprehensive examination consists of writing two full, single-authored research papers of publishable quality. This is the first one of those papers. I was inspired by a paper written by @bresnan2007predicting. In their original study, the authors challenged the traditional reliance on made-up examples in linguistics. They showed that by analyzing real-world language patterns using advanced statistical techniques, we can uncover a much richer and complex picture of how grammar actually works.
