For me, that's my Strava data (yes, I do recognize that that might sound a bit silly) -- I'm fortunate enough to have near-immediate access to some of the greatest hiking trails around (yes, I also recognize that I'm totally biased), and spending my free time romping around our local mountains has been so important for my mental health.\n\n<br>\n\n<img class=\"img-styling\" src=\"cathedral-peak.jpeg\" alt=\"A woman stands on top of a rocky peak with blue sky and chapparal-covered mountains in the background.
