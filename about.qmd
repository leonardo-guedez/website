## {{< fa chalkboard-teacher title="A teacher at a chalkboard" >}} the profession

I’m the Data Training Coordinator at the xxx Center for xxx Analysis & xxx (xxx) located at xxx, where I’m working to develop and teach xxx training xxx for the xxx (xxx) and other initiatives across xxx and xxx. I am also a xxx of xxx, a local group which works to promote xxx.

My background is in xxx – I was afforded opportunities to study xxx in xxx as an undergrad, then xxx in xxx for my Masters degree. Since the beginning of my time in STEM, I was totally terrified of all things data / coding / data science, but thanks to a super supportive community and some really rad colleagues / instructors, I found my new path and I absolutely love it.

Teaching MEDS students how to build their own personal websites using Quarto! This was especially fun for me, since Quarto was still such a new tool when I first gave this workshop -- it meant a lot of discovery and learning on-the-fly alongside our students.

I’m afforded a lot of flexibility in how I teach and what I teach. My focus is on developing and delivering xxx that supplement the xxx. I xxx primarily via xxx – I am always looking for new ways to make my teaching style and materials more approachable and inclusive for all learners.

*  the hobby
I feel very fortunate to be doing so many of things that I love a lot right now. That includes my job, but also spending lots of time outdoors. Living in Santa Barbara is a massive privilege and being here means that we have access to both the mountains and the sea, each a few minutes in either direction. It was the ocean that brought me here originally, but most of my free time is now spent on the trails.

I started recording my hikes (and eventually some other activities) on Strava in late 2020 and finally got around to retrieving my activity data using the {rStrava} package. Below is a heatmap of all my recorded activities made using leaflet. It’s challenging to see individual markers at my most frequented trailheads / starting points (toggle markers on using the layer controls in the top right corner), so I’ve recently began building out my own Strava Dashboard (using {shinydashboard}) to make it a bit more interactive and filterable – it’s a work in progress, but a fun side project that I’m excited to continue iterating upon. Huge shout out to Daniel Cullen (who also happens to be a Santa Barbara resident!) for his awesome blog post that got me started with my own map.

## {{< fa egg title="An egg" >}} the logo

I'm a proud Csik (pronounced "chick" -- Hungarian, for the curious), though I spent many of my younger years embarrassed when people (understandably) got it wrong (variations include "sea-sick," "sick," "ca-sick," to name a few) -- and many of us know how brutal little kid peers can be when there's a funny way to mispronounce a name. At some point, I learned to embrace the weird and it became very much a part of my everyday identity. My track coaches and teammates would shout "LET'S GO CSIK" during my events at meets, I signed year books as "Sam [drawing of a chick]" and every handmade card received my "The Csik Press" identifying mark on the back. As I've grown older, I've taken more care to help colleagues, peers, and strangers learn the correct pronunciation -- because if I'm being totally honest, I think my name is pretty darn cool `r fontawesome::fa("smile-wink", fill = "#64605F", a11y = "sem")`. So my first ever *real* logo is an homage to my earliest attempts at claiming my Csik identity. It may evolve a bit, but for now, it makes me pretty happy. Made using the (free!) [Adobe Express logo maker](https://www.adobe.com/express/create/logo).
