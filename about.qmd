## üìÉ My work life 

I am an undergraduate instructor and Ph.D. student in Second Language Acquisition in the Department of Linguistics, Languages, and Cultures at [Michigan State University](https://sls.msu.edu/), where I'm working on my dissertation, which examines the correction processes in the acquisition of Spanish as a foreign language.

My background is in applied linguistics / computational linguistics. I had the privilege to study applied linguistics in the top programs in my field, both in [Venezuela](http://www.usb.ve/), my home country, as well as in the US -- for my masters at [NAU](https://nau.edu/english/programs/masters-degrees/ma-tesl/ma-tesl-applied-linguistics/) through [Fulbright](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/about/fulbright-us-student-program), and now for my Ph.D. at MSU. I used to be distant to, and *intimidated* by, coding, mainly because I never thought it had any relevance to what I was doing in my field. But thanks to a couple of key moments in my career, and some really inspiring colleagues/instructors, I am now fully in love with all things programming.

In addition to my dissertation, my focus has been on using my Ph.D. time for leveraging my programming/research skills. After I discovered [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) -- and Vim motions, ü§´ -- I am always looking for new ways to make my workflow faster and more efficient. So I primarily spend my time working on my config, of course.

I started playing drums in 2003. Back then, I was playing along to songs from the bands of my era (Audioslave, Linkin Park, System of a Down, etc.). But then, I had to go heavier, right? I went quickly from Metallica, Slipknot, and Slayer, to the real extreme ones -- I'm talking Krisiun, Bathory, Vader, Nile... Every year I had to live, breathe, and play faster. Then, as my playing (and hopefully my mindset) became more mature, I delved into more technical, more musically involved stuff: I discovered bands like Death, [Cynic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynic_(band)), and Meshuggah. I did flirt with jazz for a while, I even played in a big band for about a year. I learned a lot, but eventually I acknowledged that metal was my true love.

For the past two years (after a lot of Ph.D. trauma), I've started to be intentional about going to the concerts of the bands I love. Watching Cynic for the first time was very special; not just because of their flawless playing, but mostly because Paul Masvidal transpires so much peace, and because Cynic is not a crazy famous band, so it was a very small, intimate concert. By comparison, [Ulver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulver) (already very niche band) had 132,314 monthly listeners as of Jan 20 2025, whereas [Cynic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynic_(band)) had only 38,598 monthly listeners.

I've already checked off some of the bands I had in my todo list, like Nile, Meshuggah, Cynic, Depeche Mode. The next thing in my todo list is to dive into the pit and hopefully stage dive, although I have to be careful at my age üë¥üèæ. Update: I did it already -- I fell down in the middle of the pit. I'm ok lol.
